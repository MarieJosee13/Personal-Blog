      Our purpose to creating this blog is to spread our knowledge to the
        community and also share our mistakes, what we've learnt from them. I'm
        sure some of these stories will make you laugh or make you question if
        you should take any of our advice!ðŸ˜… In all seriousness, we would like
        to be transparent with our lessons weve learnt threw time. This is a
        platform of no judment, we believe that sharing hard lessons are key to
        a greater community!
